          C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that
          runs on the .NET Framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and
          much more.
        </li>
        <code>
          using System; namespace HelloWorld { class Program { static void
          Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); } } }
        </code>
        <p>
          C# is pronounced "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming
          language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. C# has
          roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular
          languages like C++ and Java. The first version was released in year
          2002. The latest version, C# 12, was released in November 2023. C# is
          used for:
        </p>
        <li>Mobile applications</li>
          <li>Desktop applications</li>
          <li>And much, much more!</li>

          using System; namespace HelloWorld { class Program { static void

        <p></p>
        <p>Line 1: using System means that we can use classes from the System namespace.</p>
        <p>Line 2: A blank line. C# ignores white space. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.</p>
        <p>Line 3: namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.</p>
        <p>Line 4: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.</p>
        <p>Line 5: class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Program.</p>
        <p>Line 6: Don't worry if you don't understand how using System, namespace and class works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program, and that you will learn more about them in a later chapter.</p>
        <p>Line 7: Another thing that always appear in a C# program is the Main method. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed. You don't have to understand the keywords before and after Main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.</p>
        <p>Line 9: Console is a class of the System namespace, which has a WriteLine() method that is used to output/print text. In our example, it will output "Hello World!".</p>
        <p> ** If you omit the using System line, you would have to write System.Console.WriteLine() to print/output text.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Output">
        <header id="Output">Output</header>
        <p>To output values or print text in C#, you can use the WriteLine() method:</p>
        <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");</code>
        <li>You can add as many WriteLine() methods as you want.</li>
        <li>You can also output numbers, and perform mathematical calculations.</li>
        <br>
        <p>There is also a Write() method, which is similar to WriteLine():</p>
        <code>Console.Write("Hello World! ");
            Console.Write("I will print on the same line.");
        </code>

        <li>Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).</li>
        <li>Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by C# (will not be executed).</li>
        <code>// This is a comment
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        </code>
        <p>
            Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
            <br>Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by C#.

            Variables are containers for storing data values.
            <br>In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example
        </p>
        <code>// Example code for Variables</code>
        <p></p>
        <li>int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
        <li>double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
        <li>char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
        <li>string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
        <li>bool - stores values with two states: true or false</li>
